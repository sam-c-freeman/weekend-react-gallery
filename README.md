# React Photo Gallery App

## Description

_Tier 2/Week 10_
_3 Day Project_

I created a photo gallery app using React.  The app can add and delete photos.  The user also has the ability to like photos in the gallery and see more details by clicking on the image.  There are several modals included in the app that warn a user before deleting an image and also reminding them to complete all required fields.
